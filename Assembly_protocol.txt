Get ready:

1. PCB printed according to provided schematics with soldered components
2. Arduino Uno 
3. SD Card Module - EAN: 5903351241342
4. SD card for sound file
5. Amplifier - Volume Adjustable PAM8403 Amplifier Board
6. Speaker - YD50-P 0,5W 8Ohm - 50x17mm
7. IR diode - IR 333A EVL EAN: 9900002197030
8. Shocker/Scrambler Module for Startle Reflex - Product Number: ENV-414SA-SR 
9. Download "2000.wav" file
10. Download and install Arduino IDE - https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software
11. Download and install Bonsai - https://bitbucket.org/horizongir/bonsai/downloads/ (those are for Windows only)
12. Add "TMRpcm" library in Arduino IDE
13. Install Bonsai packages: 
   - Starter Pack
   - Video Library
14. Upload "2000.wav" file to SD card

Arduino Code:

1. Download file "fear_bonsai.ino" from repository
2. Upload code to Arduino Board

Bonsai Workflow:

1. Depending on experiment download either "auditory_fear_10CS.bonsai" and "auditory_test_3CS.bonsai" or 
   "context_fear_10CS.bonsai" 

Assembly:

1. Connect Arduino and Arduino modules to the PCB
2. Connect the speaker to amplifier's No. 1 terminal block
3. Slide in SD card into SD Card Module
4. Connect Arduino to computer/external power source (if you're using a laptop remember to connect it to AC for 
   proper setup grounding)
   
   WARNING - Always connect Arduino to power source first then connect shocker (Otherwise shocker will go to high 
   state and continuously deliver current) 

5. Connect IR diode to CN1 terminal block on PCB 
6. Connect Arduino controller to shocker +/- screws
7. Connect shocker to rods via D-type 9-pin connector
8. Connect camera to your computer

Getting Started:

1. Test sound volume and shock delivery by typing "a" and pressing ENTER in Serial Monitor (Ctrl+Shift+M)
2. Open Bonsai workflow of your choice. 
3. Choose camera in "VideoCaptureDevice" node
4. Specify file name and location in "VideoWriter" node (remember to add file extension at the end)
5. Press START button in Bonsai - recording and behavioral paradigm won't start until 
   "s" key is pressed
6. Put your animals into chambers
7. Press "s" key to start you paradigm
